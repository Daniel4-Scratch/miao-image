# Mia Image Exe Guide
Miao Image can be used in multiple ways. This guide will show you how to use Miao Image through the exe file.

Make sure you have the `miao.exe` file. If you dont have it, you can download it from the [releases page](https://github.com/Daniel4-Scratch/miao-image/releases)

## Convert Image to Miao File
Drag and drop an image file onto the `miao.exe` file to convert it into a Miao file. The output file will be located in the working directory with the same name as the input file but with the `.miao` extension.

## Display Miao File
Drag and drop a Miao file onto the `miao.exe` file to display it as an image. The larger the image, the longer it will take to display.

## Installer
Alternatively, you can use the installer to install Miao Image on your system. The installer will create a shortcut on your desktop and in the start menu for easy access.

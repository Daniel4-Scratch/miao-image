# Using on Different Operating Systems

What to do if you are using a different operating system.
- Windows: Use the exe
- MacOS and Linux: Use the Python source

## Python
Python is a cross-platform language, so the code should work on any operating system. You will need pip installed. Then you can install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Exe
For MacOS and Linux I recommend using the Python source instead. But if you wish you should use [wine](https://www.winehq.org/) to run the exe. For MacOS you can use [winebottler](https://winebottler.kronenberg.org/). The exe will run significantly slower than the Python source and the exe on Windows.
